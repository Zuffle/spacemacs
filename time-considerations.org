* A Time For Everything 
  As mentioned in the [[file:generic-instructions.org][generic-instructions.org]] file, you are encouraged to keep
  track of how long you spend on reading the book and doing each EPP. This
  should be *focused*, *concentrated* time --- so stop the clock before taking a
  break (for any reason, especially unexpected interruptions). Org-mode makes it
  easy to stop and restart timers.

  One reason you would do well to carefully track your time is to avoid burnout.
  In accordance with the standard \ldquo{}formula\rdquo (caveat --- only for an average
  student seeking an average grade) that you should expect to spend two hours
  outside of class for every hour in, you are not *expected* to work more than
  10 hours per week on this class. (You are also not *forbidden* to work more
  than that. Your choice.) Note that 10 hours is 8 hours in addition to the 2
  you spend in class. That is *double* the outside-of-class hours of the
  above-mentioned standard --- the reason being that this is a more demanding
  course, and you are above-average students, or else you would not be seeking
  the degrees you are.

* Advice for the Wise
  As managing time well is crucial to success in life, BYU-Idaho has some
  helpful advice here:

  Here is a quote from the STUDY HOURS FORMULA section:

  To decide how many hours you need to study each week in order to get A\rsquo{}s, use
  this rule of thumb:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Study two hours per credit hour for a lighter class, three hours per credit
   hour for an average class, and four hours per credit hour for a difficult
   class.
#+END_QUOTE

   Most students consider this a difficult class, hence 4 hours per credit hour
   equals 8 hours a week of study outside of class. Quoting again from the Time
   Management page:

   To ease your anxiety, remember that it is not only the quantity of study
   time, but also the quality of study time that counts. This formula is just a
   general guideline. You might try following it for a week, making adjustments
   as needed.

* Hints for Your First Assignment
  
  First, a Hint about Hints:

  With your cursor on a :HINT: line, pressing TAB will toggle the open/close
  state of these \ldquo{}drawers\rdquo, as org-mode refers to them.

  They are all closed when you first open this file. Open them only after you
  take the opportunity to see how far you can get without them.

  Also, at the top of this file note the \ldquo{}not\rdquo in the first #+OPTIONS: header.
  This controls the invisibility of the HINT drawers when exporting this org
  file to html, which you can do by the following key sequence:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  , e e h o
#+END_EXAMPLE

  - CRC
:HINT:
  - Hint :: Do not be picky about the wording \ldquo{}There is no right answer\rdquo, which
            could be interpreted as \ldquo{}There is no answer that you could give that
            would be right.\rdquo That would be a misinterpretation.

  - Hint :: Lewis Carroll is your friend here.

:HINT:
  - Hint :: A \ldquo{}word\rdquo with no vowels is a clear winner of the largest contest ---
            a CVR can\rsquo{}t be more than infinity. So don\rsquo{}t count CVRs like that.
            (That is why /finite/ was stipulated.) With that, tying for first
            place at 3 (to 1) would be \lsquo{}What\rsquo and \lsquo{}word\rsquo, with CVR at 3 (to 0)
            disqualified.
  - Also :: Count /y/ as a vowel, even when it is the first letter of a word.
:END:

  - DZB
:HINT:
  - Hint :: Another name for this problem is the /Limiting Radius/ problem, and
            a /trigonometric approach/ to it is suggested by this image:

  - DOK
:HINT:
  - Hint :: In case it wasn\rsquo{}t clear, you are being asked to form the product of
            3 numbers. And to do that over and over again, as many times as it
            takes.
  - Hint :: Try dividing all the products by 6.
  - Time Hint :: There is another connection to be made, but to pursue this
                 quest is potentially time-consuming.
:END:

  - CJF
:HINT:
  - Hint :: Split the 6-digit number into two 3-digit numbers, and think of the
            word CLOCK (what CLAHCK really should be) as a sequence of 5 letters:
: 654 321
:
: C L O C K
