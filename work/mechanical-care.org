* How To Avoid MIsery
** Take Mechanical Care
  Do you take pride in your writing? Enough to free it of *mechanical
  infelicities* (MIs --- e.g., misspelled words, grammatical errors, punctuation
  errors, formatting errors)?

  Even if you are hard pressed to produce good solutions, you can always take
  steps to eliminate MIs in the solutions you do write up, for example:

  1. Spell-check and grammar-check your writing. (Have you heard of Grammarly?)
  2. Read your writing aloud (or better yet, have someone else read it to you)
     to see how it sounds.
  3. Have someone who is good at English carefully proofread your writing.

** Reap a Possible Grading Benefit
   Come discuss with me how this possibility might be realized.
